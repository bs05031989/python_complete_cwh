Variables and data types
variable = container to store a value
keyword = reserved words
identifiers = class/function/variable name
python automatically identifies data type for us
print(type (a)) = <class, 'str'>
Variable names can start with alphabets and _
variables do not start with digits and white spaces
variables are case sensitive as well
There are four types of basic operators : Arithmetic, Assignment, Comparative, Logical
Logical works on boolean
AND : Both operands need to be true
OR : Any operands need to be true
Type casting : converting one data type to another
